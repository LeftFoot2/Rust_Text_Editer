# Overview

{Important! Do not say in this section that this is college assignment. Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}

{Provide a description of the software that you wrote to demonstrate the Rust language.}

For this project I set out to learn some of the basics of the Rust language. To do so I decided to create a program that would edit the word in a txt file. This way you wouldn't have to read words you didn't want to. I ran into quite a few problems on the way, but you can see the finished product in the video bellow.
